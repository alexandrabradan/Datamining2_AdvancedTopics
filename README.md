# Datamining2_AdvancedTopics
Project for the first module of the Data Mining course held at University of Pisa.

# Project Guidelines
# Module 1 - Introduction, Imbalanced Learning and Anomaly Detection
    1. Explore and prepare the dataset. You are allowed to take inspiration from the associated GitHub repository 
    (https://github.com/mdeff/fma) and figure out your personal research perspective   
    (from choosing a subset of variables to the class to predict…). 
    You are welcome in creating new variables and performing all the pre-processing steps the dataset needs;
    2. Define one or more (simple) classification tasks and solve it with Decision Tree and KNN. You decide 
    the target variable;
    3.Identify the top 1% outliers: adopt at least three different methods from different families 
    (e.g., density-based, angle-based… ) 
    and compare the results. Deal with the outliers by removing them from the dataset or by treating the 
    anomalous variables as missing values and employing replacement techniques.
    In this second case, you should check that the outliers are not outliers anymore. 
    Justify your choices in every step;
    4.Analyze the value distribution of the class to predict with respect to point 2; 
    if it is unbalanced leave it as it is, otherwise turn the dataset into an imbalanced version 
    (e.g., 96% - 4%, for binary classification). 
    Then solve the classification task using the Decision Tree or the KNN by adopting various 
    techniques of imbalanced learning;
    5. Draw your conclusions about the techniques adopted in this analysis.
    
    N.B. When “solving the classification task”, remember, (i) to test, when needed, different criteria
    for the parameter estimation of the algorithms, and (ii) to evaluate the classifiers 
    (e.g., Accuracy, F1, Lift Chart) in order to compare the results obtained with an imbalanced technique 
    against those obtained from using the “original” dataset.
